Face Recognition Attendance System

A Python-based Face Recognition Attendance System that captures student faces, trains a recognition model, and marks attendance automatically.
This project uses OpenCV, Tkinter, and pickle-based face encodings to build a simple but functional attendance tool.

🚀 Features

Capture student images through webcam

Train face encodings using OpenCV

Real-time face recognition for attendance

Tkinter-based GUI

Stores face encodings locally using pickle

Easy to use and extend
